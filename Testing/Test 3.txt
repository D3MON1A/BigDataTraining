The driver starts the execution of the statement creating sessions, and acts as a collection point of data result obtained after the reduce operation,
then the compiler perform the compilation of the HiveQl query, and it will be convert in an execution plan,  the plan contain the tasks and the steps 
needed for the performance of the MapReduce. The compiler converts the query to an AST than check for compability then converts the AST to a Directed Acyclic Graph.
